## 🚀 About Me
I’m a developer and security researcher passionate about **digging deep into systems** and uncovering how they really work.  
My main interests revolve around **reverse engineering, Windows internals, and kernel-level development**, but I also enjoy working across the stack with tools, frameworks, and languages that push my knowledge further.  

- 🔐 Exploring **system internals, reverse engineering, and vulnerability research**  
- ⚙️ Skilled in **low-level programming, kernel drivers, and memory management**  
- 🌐 Experienced across the stack: **backend, frontend, and system programming**  
- 📚 Driven by curiosity—always experimenting, breaking things, and learning from them
